# Image-Stitching-from-a-Video.
This project provides a Python pipeline for image stitching and mapping from video frames, specifically designed for drone-based surveillance. The code automatically extracts frames from a drone video, detects and matches features, estimates homographies, and stitches the images together to generate a large, seamless map of the surveyed area.
